Hey there, my name is Tyler "Tdback" Dunneback. I'm currently an IDAM intern at Zoetis, and live in the great state of Michigan, USA.

I really enjoy using both Linux and Emacs, and I love spending time hacking on both. In fact, I wrote this website using org-mode in Emacs! I also really enjoy learning new programming languages, and have written projects in, or am currently using:
- Emacs Lisp
- Common Lisp
- Go 
- C
- Lua
- Python
- PowerShell
- Shell (Bash || Zsh)

I also run both infrastructure at home and in the cloud. In both environments I utilize tools like Docker, Podman, and Ansible to automate the deployment and maintenance of several services that I use daily. I also have a strong passion for privacy, security, and the freedom of information. 

If you're not a spammer, feel free to contact me!
