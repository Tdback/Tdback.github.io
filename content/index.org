Hey there, my name is Tyler "Tdback" Dunneback. This website is currently undergoing some changes, but don't let that stop you from reading onward!

I really enjoy using both Linux and Vim, and I love spending time hacking on both. In fact, I've even started my own [[https://www.youtube.com/@TylerDunneback/][YouTube]] channel to teach others more about Linux. I also really enjoy learning new programming languages, and have written projects in, or am currently using:
- Emacs Lisp
- Go
- Lua
- POSIX Shell / Bash
- PowerShell
- Python

Aside from programming, I also run infrastructure at home and in the cloud. In both environments I utilize tools like Docker, Podman, and Ansible to automate the deployment and maintenance of several services that I use daily. I also have a strong passion for privacy, security, and the freedom of information.

If you're not a spammer, feel free to contact me by email or follow me on [[https://github.com/Tdback/][GitHub]]!
