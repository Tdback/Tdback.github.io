Hey there, my name is Tyler "Tdback" Dunneback.

First and foremost, I love all things Linux, automation, and open source!
I am also a strong advocate for the right to privacy and security.

I am currently in my final semester of university, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Security and Intelligence. My studies have ranged from network and cloud security to AI model design and development.

I love to script and can often be found hacking away in the following languages:
- POSIX Shell & Bash
- Python
- PowerShell

Occasionally I may sprinkle in a few other languages here and there, as learning them is half the fun!

I also love to run my own infrastructure both at home and in the cloud. This is made possible with tools such as [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]], [[https://podman.io/][Podman]], [[https://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]], and [[https://opentofu.org/][OpenTofu]].

When away from my keyboard, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our labrador "Captain".

If you're not a spammer, feel free to contact me by email or follow me on [[https://github.com/Tdback/][GitHub]]!
