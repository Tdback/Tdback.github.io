Hey there, my name is Tyler "Tdback" Dunneback. I currently work as an IDAM intern at Zoetis, and live in the great state of Michigan, USA.

I really enjoy using both Linux and Emacs, and I love spending time hacking on both. In fact, I wrote and published this website using org-mode in Emacs (and a little help from GitHub)! I also really enjoy learning new programming languages, and have written projects in, or am currently using:
- C
- Emacs Lisp
- Go 
- Lua
- OCaml
- POSIX Shell / Bash
- PowerShell
- Python

Aside from programming, I also run infrastructure at home and in the cloud. In both environments I utilize tools like Docker, Podman, and Ansible to automate the deployment and maintenance of several services that I use daily. I also have a strong passion for privacy, security, and the freedom of information. 

If you're not a spammer, feel free to contact me by email or follow me on [[https://github.com/Tdback/][GitHub]]!
