Hey there, my name is Tyler "Tdback" Dunneback. I'm currently an IDAM intern at Zoetis, and live in the great state of Michigan, USA. 

I really enjoy using both Arch Linux and Emacs, and can be found spending time hacking on both regularly. In fact, this website was written using org-mode in Emacs! I also really enjoy learning new programming languages, and have written projects in, or am currently using:
- OCaml
- C
- Lua
- Python
- PowerShell
- Shell (Bash / Zsh / Fish)
- Emacs Lisp

If you're not a spammer, feel free to contact me!
