Hey there, my name is Tyler "Tdback" Dunneback.
</p>

<p>
Here's a little bit about me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm a firm believer in the phrase "Automate any job you do more than once". Life is too short to manually backup your files every night, so write a script do it for you!
</p>

<p>
I love all things to do with Linux, automation, and open source. In fact, this website is open source and freely hosted on GitHub! You can view all the code I use to build it <a href="https://github.com/Tdback/Tdback.github.io">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I love computer and programming language history! Some of my favorite topics include technology and protocols such as IRC, and of course classic games like Quake and Super Mario Brothers! I also enjoy learning the family of programming languages known as Lisp, specifically Guile Scheme, Common Lisp, and Emacs Lisp.
</p>

<p>
I am also a strong advocate for the right to privacy and security. 
</p>

<p>
When away from my keyboard, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our Labrador "<a href="captain.html">Captain</a>".
</p>

<p>
I am currently in my final semester of university, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Security and Intelligence. My studies have ranged from system, network, and cloud security to AI model design and development. I have also achieved various industry certifications: CompTIA Security+, AWS Certified Cloud Pracitioner (CCP), and AWS Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA).
</p>
