<p>
When I released my first every blog post back in March, I claimed that I would release a new post at least once a week. Boy, was I wrong. I oftentimes spent a week alone writing each post, and out of the three blog posts I wrote, all of them were about a month apart from each other. Talk about not delivering to the people.
</p>

<p>
Near the end of my last spring semester in university (only one more semester to go!) I got fairly busy with moving into an apartment downstate and eventually abandoned my website altogether to focus on other projects I had planned out. During that time I nearly did a 180 on my workflow, and I poured hours into finding ways to automate even the smallest tasks so I can spend more time on what matters to me: my fiancee, family and friends, and of course learning more about technology. That experience not only changed the way I look at technology, but it gave me a greater appreciation for what I know and re-kindled that little fire I still had for writing crappy blog posts about technology non-nerds probably don't care about. So, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my rebooted blog!
</p>

<p>
So what changed? Well, I'm glad you asked :)
</p>

<p>
The biggest issue I had with my past blog posts were that they took too much time to both read and write. My fiancee even admitted to not wanting to read them because each one alone would take at least five to ten minutes. And, as I previously mentioned, it sometimes took me weeks to write. So now I'm putting a focus on quick, two to three minute reads about technology I think people should learn, rants on what I find wrong with the world, and sometimes a quick burst of thoughts I find important to share. Sprinkle in some poor humor, a touch of sarcasm, and I think I've got an award winning blog in the making.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, I want to write about technology in a way that even non-nerds enjoy it. My past blog posts were filled with technical jargon to the brim, and I'm positive that turned away a couple of my readers. So for the non-technical readers out there, I think you'll find these posts a lot more palatable. 
</p>

<p>
I also looked into ways to implement a mailing list of sorts, but every solution I researched was locked behind a monthly subscription, which is an expense I'd rather avoid at the moment. So for now, if you'd like to receive updates when a new blog post is released, send me an email [at] <code>tylerdback@pm.me</code> and I'll happily add you to my mailing list!
